# Ansible Inventory allows specifying several groups for one host, creating a one-to-many connection between hosts and groups. 
# Termius supports only one-to-one connection between hosts and groups. 
# By default, when you use the Termius role, it will create one group per host and assign a host to this group.
# By setting use_groups_instead_of_tags: false your hosts will be organized with tags instead of groups in Termius.

# Termius role uses API Bridge, which requires every entity to have an external ID.  By default, ansible_host is used. 
# Use host_id_key and group_id_key to fetch a custom external ID from your Ansible inventory. 
# For example, with the Digital Ocean dynamic inventory, set host_id_key=do_id to use the Droplet's ID as an external ID for Termius entities.
